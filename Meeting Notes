- Edge layer seems the most promising 
- Model = State machines? = log device history 
- match low level traffic with high level traffic
- mozilla firefox gateway, look into gateways
- edge layer extended api that IoT devices MUST use to communicate allowing traffic to be logged and discrepencies to be found 

Initial steps are to narrow down the scope of the project to allow for a solid plan and to research recent literature (check EdgeSec references).
